## üéØ Verification Overview

**Purpose**: Confirm that all metadata components have been deployed correctly and the application is fully functional.

**When to use this guide**:
- ‚úÖ After successful deployment (`sf project deploy start` returned success)
- ‚úÖ After permission set assignment completed
- ‚úÖ After sample data seeding executed (via CLI or Developer Console)
- ‚ùå **If deployment failed**: Use [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) first

**What this verification covers**:
- Lightning Application accessibility and navigation
- Custom object functionality and data integrity
- Permission set effectiveness
- Object relationships and field validation
- Overall user experience testing

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### 1. Lightning Application Verification

**Objective**: Confirm the Tech Solutions Lightning App is accessible and properly configured.

**Steps**:
1. **Access App Launcher**:
   - In your Salesforce org, click the **App Launcher** (9 dots icon) in the top left corner
   - Search for "Tech Solutions" in the search box
   - **Expected Result**: Tech Solutions app should appear in the search results

2. **Open the Application**:
   - Click on the **Tech Solutions** app to open it
   - **Expected Result**: The app should load without errors

3. **Verify Navigation**:
   - Check that the following tabs are visible in the navigation bar:
     - **Home** (standard Salesforce tab)
     - **Devices** (custom tab)
     - **Device Orders** (custom tab)
   - **Expected Result**: All three tabs should be visible and clickable

**Educational Insight**: The Lightning App serves as a container that organizes related tabs and provides a branded experience. The fact that you can see and access the app confirms that the CustomApplication metadata deployed correctly.

### 2. Custom Object Verification

**Objective**: Verify that custom objects (Device__c and Device_Order__c) are accessible and functional.

#### Device Object Verification

**Steps**:
1. **Navigate to Devices Tab**:
   - Click on the **Devices** tab in the Tech Solutions app
   - **Expected Result**: The Devices list view should load

2. **Verify Sample Data**:
   - You should see 5 device records with the following details:
     ```
     Name: MacBook Pro | Type: Laptop | Price: $2,499.00 | Stock: 25 | Active: ‚úì
     Name: iPhone 15 | Type: Smartphone | Price: $999.00 | Stock: 50 | Active: ‚úì
     Name: iPad Air | Type: Tablet | Price: $599.00 | Stock: 30 | Active: ‚úì
     Name: Dell XPS 13 | Type: Laptop | Price: $1,299.00 | Stock: 15 | Active: ‚úì
     Name: Samsung Galaxy S24 | Type: Smartphone | Price: $899.00 | Stock: 40 | Active: ‚úì
     ```

3. **Test Record Access**:
   - Click on any device record to open its detail page
   - **Expected Result**: Record should open showing all field values

4. **Verify Field Functionality**:
   - Check that all custom fields are visible:
     - **Type__c** (Picklist: Laptop/Smartphone/Tablet)
     - **Stock_Quantity__c** (Number)
     - **Price__c** (Currency)
     - **Active__c** (Checkbox)

#### Device Order Object Verification

**Steps**:
1. **Navigate to Device Orders Tab**:
   - Click on the **Device Orders** tab
   - **Expected Result**: The Device Orders list view should load

2. **Verify Sample Data**:
   - You should see 3 device order records:
     ```
     Order 1: MacBook Pro | Quantity: 2 | Status: Confirmed
     Order 2: iPhone 15 | Quantity: 5 | Status: Confirmed  
     Order 3: iPad Air | Quantity: 3 | Status: Draft
     ```

3. **Test Master-Detail Relationship**:
   - Open any Device Order record
   - Click on the **Device** lookup field
   - **Expected Result**: Should navigate to the related Device record
   - **Educational Insight**: This confirms the master-detail relationship is working correctly

### 3. Permission Set Verification

**Objective**: Confirm that the TechSolutions_Admin permission set is properly assigned and functional.

**Steps**:
1. **Verify Object Access**:
   - You should be able to view both Devices and Device Orders tabs
   - **Expected Result**: No "Insufficient Privileges" errors

2. **Test CRUD Operations**:
   - Try creating a new Device record:
     - Click **New** button on Devices tab
     - Fill in required fields
     - Save the record
   - **Expected Result**: Record should save successfully

3. **Verify Tab Visibility**:
   - Both custom tabs should be visible in the Tech Solutions app
   - **Expected Result**: No hidden or inaccessible tabs

### 4. Data Integrity Verification

**Objective**: Ensure data relationships and constraints are working correctly.

**Steps**:
1. **Verify Lookup Relationships**:
   - Open a Device Order record
   - Confirm the Device field shows the correct related device
   - **Expected Result**: Proper device name and link functionality

2. **Test Picklist Values**:
   - Edit a Device record
   - Check the Type field dropdown
   - **Expected Result**: Should show options: Laptop, Smartphone, Tablet

3. **Verify Required Fields**:
   - Try creating a Device without a Name
   - **Expected Result**: Should show validation error

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Insufficient Privileges" Error

**Symptoms**: Cannot access custom tabs or objects
**Root Cause**: Permission set not assigned or incorrectly configured
**Solution**:
```bash
# Re-assign permission set
sf org assign permset --name TechSolutions_Admin --target-org GTP5org
```

### Issue: No Sample Data Visible

**Symptoms**: Tabs load but no records are shown
**Root Cause**: Data seeding script didn't execute successfully
**Solution**: Execute data seeding manually via Developer Console (see TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Issue: Tabs Not Visible in App

**Symptoms**: Tech Solutions app loads but custom tabs are missing
**Root Cause**: CustomApplication metadata issue or permission problem
**Solutions**:
1. Verify deployment: `sf project deploy report --target-org GTP5org`
2. Check permission set assignment
3. Refresh browser and clear cache

### Issue: Relationship Fields Not Working

**Symptoms**: Device lookup in Device Order doesn't show related records
**Root Cause**: Master-detail relationship configuration issue
**Solution**: Verify object deployment and field metadata

## üìä Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

‚úÖ **Application Access**: Tech Solutions app is visible and accessible
‚úÖ **Navigation**: All three tabs (Home, Devices, Device Orders) are functional
‚úÖ **Data Visibility**: 5 Device records and 3 Device Order records are visible
‚úÖ **Relationships**: Device Orders properly link to Device records
‚úÖ **Permissions**: Can create, read, update records without errors
‚úÖ **Field Functionality**: All custom fields display correct data types and values

## üéì Educational Takeaways

### What This Verification Process Teaches

1. **Systematic Testing**: Professional developers always verify deployments systematically
2. **User Experience Focus**: Testing from the end-user perspective catches real-world issues
3. **Relationship Validation**: Object relationships are critical and must be tested thoroughly
4. **Permission Verification**: Security settings can break functionality if not properly configured
5. **Data Integrity**: Sample data helps validate that the data model works as designed

### Real-World Application

This verification process mirrors what happens in enterprise Salesforce development:
- **QA Testing**: Quality assurance teams follow similar checklists
- **User Acceptance Testing**: End users verify functionality before go-live
- **Production Validation**: Post-deployment verification in production environments
- **Documentation**: Verification results become part of deployment documentation
